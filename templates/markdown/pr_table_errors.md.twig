### About linked issues

Please consider opening an issue before submitting a Pull Request:
* If it's a bug fix, it helps maintainers verify that the bug is effectively due to a defect in the code, and that it hasn't been fixed already.
* It can help trigger a discussion about the best implementation path before a single line of code is written.
* It may lead the Core Product team to mark that issue as a priority, further attracting the maintainers' attention.
